# White Box VPN

Welcome to the [White Box VPN](https://whiteboxvpn.com) GitHub profile. White Box VPN is sort of like a VPN provider but where you can deploy and run your own VPN server(s).

## How It Works

You can create an account on the White Box VPN dashboard. After you've logged in, you can create one or more servers. After they have been created, you can connect to them using the White Box VPN client. Here's a demo:

## Development

 Currently, I've only made the CLI repository public and have released it under the GPL 3. As soon as I can clean up the other repositories, I'll plan to release them as well.
 
 Feel free to submit a pull request to help out the project.
